cookbook
========

This is just a place for me to hack together a little recipe web app.

h2. Commands

h3. Installation Commands

These commands install any dependencies you need to run cookbook locally.

- Install everything
```bash
$ make install
```

- Install mongodb
```bash
$ make install-mongo
```

h3. Server Commands

Be sure to run these commands in separate terminals.

- Start web server
```bash
$ node server.js
```

$ make start-db
```
